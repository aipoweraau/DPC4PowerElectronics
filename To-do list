To-Do List

1. Single Prediction Horizon
   - Implement DPC training with a single prediction horizon

2. Multi-Prediction Horizon
   - Implement DPC training with multiple prediction horizons
   - Comparative analysis of single vs. multiple prediction horizons:
     - Compare training time
     - Compare training sample requirements
     - Assess robustness across horizons
     - Evaluate the impact of hidden layer and neuron configurations on training performance

3. System Parameter Identification
   - Identify the system parameter matrix using DPC/KAN

4. Simulation and Experiment Alignment
   - Compensate for physical discrepancies between simulation and experimental setups

5. Parallel Task
   - Build datasets under varying system conditions:
     - Changes in load
     - Changes in reference signals
     - Variations in system parameters
