To-Do List

1. Single Prediction Horizon
   - Implement DPC training with a single prediction horizon

2. Multi-Prediction Horizon
   - Implement DPC training with multiple prediction horizons
   - Comparative analysis of single vs. multiple prediction horizons:
     - Compare training time
     - Compare training sample requirements
     - Assess robustness across horizons
     - Evaluate the impact of hidden layer and neuron configurations on training performance

3. System Parameter Identification
   - Identify the system parameter matrix using DPC/KAN

4. Simulation and Experiment Alignment
   - Compensate for physical discrepancies between simulation and experimental setups

5. Parallel Task
   - Build datasets under varying system conditions:
     - Changes in load
     - Changes in reference signals
     - Variations in system parameters

"Cookbook" for DPC 
   - improve the figure - show in separate subfigures the three activities: data collection, training, deployment/implementation in the target system
   - show steps on how to design and implement, what performance metrics should be used 
   - analyze the impact of parameters on the performance (network width and depth, number of data points used for training, data sampling rate, noise level)
   - give guidelines: on which problems will it work, what is a limitation, what is the risk of implementing it in a system 
   - do we need experimental data for it to work, what should be the ratio - can we find out what is missing in the simulation data so we can modify it to be more like experimental data
